<p align="center">
  <em>A game of navigation through darkness using echolocation</em>  
</p>

## 🎮 Game Concept

In **Echo World**, you are dropped into a world of **complete darkness**.  
The only way to see is by sending out sound waves that briefly reveal your surroundings.

- Emit **echo waves** to light up walls, enemies, and collectibles  
- Navigate **randomly generated mazes**  
- Avoid enemies chasing you in the shadows  
- Collect glowing orbs for score  
- Find the exit to complete the level  
- Manage your **limited echoes** wisely!
