<h1 align="center">🌌 Echo World 🌌</h1>
<p align="center">
  <em>A game of navigation through darkness using echolocation</em>  
</p>

---

## 🎮 Game Concept

In **Echo World**, you are dropped into a world of **complete darkness**.  
The only way to see is by sending out sound waves that briefly reveal your surroundings.

- Emit **echo waves** to light up walls, enemies, and collectibles  
- Navigate **randomly generated mazes**  
- Avoid enemies chasing you in the shadows  
- Collect glowing orbs for score  
- Find the exit to complete the level  
- Manage your **limited echoes** wisely!

## 🕹️ Controls

- **WASD / Arrow Keys** → Move your character  
- **SPACE** → Emit an echo wave  
- **Mouse Click** → Targeted echo at cursor  
- **R** → Restart game (after win/lose)  
- **F / F11** → Toggle fullscreen  
- **ESC** → Quit game

## 📊 Scoring System

- **+100 pts** → Each collectible orb  
- **+50 pts** → Each unused echo at level completion  
- **Time Bonus** → The faster you finish, the more you score  
- Total score = *Skill + Speed + Stealth*
